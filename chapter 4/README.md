Topics Covered:
Message Passing Interface
Files Overview
1. Avoiding_Deadlock.py
Description: Demonstrates point-to-point communication with proper send/receive calls to avoid deadlock.
Features:

Process 0 sends an integer to process 4.
Process 1 sends a string to process 8.
Processes 4 and 8 receive and print the respective messages.
2. Collective_Communication_using_Broadcast.py
Description: Illustrates collective communication using the bcast function.
Features:

Process 0 shares a variable (variable_to_share) with all other processes.
All processes print the shared variable after broadcasting.
3. Collective_Communication_Using_gather_funcation.py
Description: Shows the use of the gather function for collective communication.
Features:

Each process computes its data as (rank + 1)^2.
The root process (rank 0) gathers data from all processes and prints it.
4. Collective_Communication_Using_Scatter_function.py
Description: Demonstrates the scatter function for collective communication.
Features:

Process 0 initializes an array and distributes its elements among all processes.
Each process prints the element it received.
5. Point-to-Point Implementation.py
Description: Provides another example of point-to-point communication with distinct messages and processes.
Features:

Process 0 sends an integer to process 4.
Process 1 sends a string to process 8.
Processes 4 and 8 receive and print the respective messages.
