Topics Covered:
Asynchronous Programming
Files Overview
1. asyncio_coroutine.py
Description: Simulates a finite state machine using Python's asyncio library.
Features: Implements states (start_state, state1, state2, state3, end_state) with asynchronous transitions using yield from.
asyncio_coroutine

2. asyncio_event_looop.py
Description: Demonstrates an event-driven model with asyncio.
Features: Circular scheduling of tasks (task_A, task_B, task_C) with loop.call_later. Runs for a defined time (60 seconds).
asyncio_event_loop

3. HeavyComputationSimulation.py
Description: Simulates heavy computation using sequential, thread pool, and process pool execution.
Features: Compares execution methods for a computation-heavy task (count).
HeavyComputationSimulation

4. ThreadPoolExecutor.py
Description: Demonstrates task execution with ThreadPoolExecutor.
Features: Executes single and multiple tasks with the cube function and gracefully shuts down the executor.
